// Define a function named test_prime that checks whether a given number n is a prime number
// Check if the number is equal to 1, which is not a prime number
// Check if the number is equal to 2, which is a prime number
// Iterate from 2 to n-1 to check for factors of n
// If n is divisible by x without a remainder, it is not a prime number
// If no factors are found, the number is a prime number
// Log the result of calling test_prime with the input number 37 to the console
